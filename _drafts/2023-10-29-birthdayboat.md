Today I went to Phou Si, the Traditional Arts and Ethnology Center, the Night Market, and several wats. I also took a riverboat cruise on the Mekong with all the Fulbrighters, Princeton in Asia Fellows, and Luce Fellows to celebrate Christina P.'s birthday. Tonight is Awk Pansaa, the end of Buddhist Lent. 

## Phou Si

Before I went to Phou Si, I went to a French café in the center of town. Luang Prabang is famous for its blend of French and Lao culture, which is especially present in the unique architecture that blends the two styles. There are also a lot of French cafés here and many of the signs are in Lao, French, and English (in that order). I had a quiche and a pain au chocolate for breakfast, which were very good. 

Max, Janus, and I climbed to the top of Phou Si to see the wat at the top and the view of the entire town. The wat at the top was built in 1805, but legend has it that the site has been special for hundreds of years. According to legend, the great varana (monkey-human from the great Sanskrit epic, *The Ramayana*) Hanuman carried the hill from Sri Lanka to Laos long ago. Hanuman is revered throughout Southeast Asia. I found this particularly interesting since I am currently reading an abridged, poetic version of *The Ramayana*! (The full book is 20,000 pages, so I thought an abriged version would be better.)

 The view from the top of Phou Si

 Luang Prabang is surrounded by mountains, and the Mekong runs next to town. I had a beautiful view, and I enjoyed taking in the town. 

 People come to Phou Si to see the wat and to take in the view. Many people bring banana leaves with marigolds, hanging trees with money, banana leaf holders with marigolds and candles, small woven cages with birds, and food as offerings for the monks. Many people carry their offerings up the steps.

Many people buy small woven cages with sparrows in them and release them at the temple. Then, people dispose of the cages. Notice the small bird cages in the small tree in the foreground.

Stupa at Phou Si

When we left Phou Si, we saw many golden Buddha statues on the way down. We also saw a naga with heads that needed to be painted, which was interesting since we saw a headless naga earlier in the artistic process earlier that day.

## The Traditional Arts and Ethnology Center (TAEC)

After visiting Phou Si, we went to the TAEC in Vientiane. They had a special event that focused on making biodegradeable boats for the holiday, so we wanted to participate. We made our boats before going through the museum. The event was very popular, so we wanted to make sure that we could get a spot. I will talk more about the significance of the boats tomorrow when I send my boat down the river.

After I made my boat, I went through the TAEC museum. I saw many examples of clothing from ethnic groups throughout Laos.

## Riverboat Cruise

At 6:00, all the Fulbrighters, Princeton in Asia Fellows, and Luce Fellows met at a boat on the Mekong. Our Fulbright researcher friend, Anna, has family in Luang Prabang who own a boat company. She and Christina organized a riverboat cruise and dinner for Christina's birthday. There were traditional Lao foods served on board like sticky rice, pork knuckles, a Lao beef jerky, and papaya salad. There were also French fries. 

We all sang karaoke and had a great time. Towards the end, they brought out two cakes that everyone could share for Christina P.'s birthday. The views from the boat were beautiful before the sun set. I'm happy that I got to celebrate Christina P.'s birthday with her in such a meaningful way.

## Awk Pansaa

After we got off the boat, we walked around the Night Market and went wat hopping. I didn't buy anything at the Night Market since I was focused on visiting as many wats as possible since they only have the paper lanterns up until tomorrow night. 

We saw many beautiful paper lantern creations and probably visited 5 or 6 wats. I've included some of my favorite lantern creations below.

	y  = * ( float * ) &i;
	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
