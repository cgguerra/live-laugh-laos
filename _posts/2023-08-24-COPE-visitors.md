title: The Secret War in Laos

Today we went to the COPE (Cooperative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise) Visitor Center as part of our orientation organized by the embassy. COPE seeks to provide nationwide physical rehabilitation services throughout Laos and to educate people about the importance of offering prosthetic and orthotic health services to rural and remote communities affected by UXOs (unexploded ordinances) and to individuals with mobility-related disabilities. COPE works in close partnership with the Lao government to provide prosthetic and orthotic services free of charge to those who have need of assistance, allowing them to regain mobility and dignity.

## The Long-Lasting Effects of the Secret War in Laos

The Vietnam War is notoriously difficult to explain and rarely taught well in American schools and universities. I will not attempt to explain it. Rather, I advise and encourage you to read this extensive and comprehensive article that covers the history of the [Vietnam War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Vietnam-War/The-U-S-role-grows) in depth.

In relation to Lao history, it is important to know that the Ho Chi Minh Trail runs throughout north to south Vietnam and almost spans the length of the entire country. The Ho Chi Minh Trail is in east Vietnam touching the eastern border of southeastern Laos. The U.S. dropped many bombs here from 1964 to 1973 as part of a Secret War to discourage Communism (this also happened in Cambodia) and to fight the Viet Cong (the Vietnamese Communists from North Vietnam). The U.S. dropped bombs to try and hinder the Viet Cong's operations along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and damage the surrounding areas. (For reference, the Vietnam War officially lasted from 1962 to 1973, but the conflict between the U.S. and Northern Vietnam began in 1959.)

This map shows where the U.S. dropped bombs in Laos during the Secret War. 

The U.S. dropped over 2 million tons of bombs throughout southeastern Laos, making Laos the most heavily bombed country in the world per capita in history. The region of Xieng Khuang (pronounced "sheng kwang") in the northeast was the most heavily bombed of all regions. The U.S. dropped many bombs on rice fields and farmers' homes, causing many people to flee to the forest. However, many Lao people were struck by bombs and killed when escaping to safety. The villagers then began to dig holes to hide in to try and avoid the bombs; however, the U.S. airplanes throught they were Viet Cong soldiers and tried to bomb the holes, killing many and trapping them inside. Many Lao villagers reported seeing hands and feet of people who were bombed sticking out of holes in the ground. After the U.S. airplanes bombed many Lao villagers hiding in holes, the people fled to the caves located in the forest. Many people were killing while fleeing. Many Lao families hid in caves for a long time to avoid the bombs, fearing the sound of airplanes and the bombs they brought with them.

The U.S. dropped many different types of bombs, but the cluster munitions have proven to be the most deadly of all. Cluster munitions are small bombs the size of an orange called "bombies" that come in a giant shell that opens when it is dropped from an airplane. The fins on the tail of the shell cause the giant casing to spin, setting off the cluster munitions. However, up to 30% failed to detonate, and remained in Laos after the war. This means that approximately 80 million unexploded bombies remained in Laos after the end of the Vietnam War.

As a result of the heavy bombing across Laos, many rice fields and rural areas were littered with bombs. Bombies do not explode if they are buried underground and if someone steps on top of them. This makes farming across Laos very dangerous since they are still bombs buried in the soil that only explode if they are agitated (e.g., with a hoe). However, the most common cause of a bombie explosion is when people, especially children, search for scrap metal. A primitive Vietnamese metal detector costs about 100,000 kip ($5), and children often purchase these despite their high price to supplement their family's low income. A child can make around 10,000 to 20,000 kip per kilo of scrap metal, making this a good way to make money and pay back the loan for the metal detector fairly quickly. However, due to a lack of education in recognizing bombs from the war, many children accidentally set off the bombs when trying to collect them.

Another common cause of a bombie explosion is when families cook in on the dirt floor of a very basic house. These types of houses are mostly found in rural areas. A person could be cooking over a fire and a bombie buried underneath the ground could detonate from the heat, spreading shrapnel and killing or seriously maiming people within a 30 meter radius. 

Other instances in which bombs explode today include when children find the bombies and play with them thinking that they are toy metal balls and when people collect forest products.

This sign appears at the beginning of the museum to convey the long-lasting impact of cluster bombs on Lao land and the danger they pose to Lao people living in rural areas. 

The long-lasting effects of the Secret War are still felt in Laos. Lao people do not like to talk about the Secret War because it is painful to remember.

This is a statue outside the COPE Visitor Center depicting a mother and child fleeing from the bombs dropped by American planes during the Secret War in Laos. The inscription says "The sculpture is made from 500kg of UXO (sic), Including (sic) cluster bombs in memory of those who been (sic) injured, lost their lives or loved ones from UXO (sic)." This work of art was created by Anousone Vong Aphay, a local artist, in 2008.

## Traces of the Secret War in Lao Homes

There are still traces of the Secret War in rural Lao homes today. In many rural areas people fashion tools, bowls, and other materials from the metal from parachute flare containers, recycled UXO steel, cluster bomb casings, mortars, etc.

## How the COPE helps Lao people

COPE helps survivors of UXOs individuals with mobility-related disabilities by providing them with prosthetic and orthotic services free of charge. COPE is sponsored by several governments, including the U.S., and non-profits who want to rehabilitate people and help them to regain their sense of mobility with prosthethics and physical therapy. COPE provides custom prosthetics to people in need. However, since demand is high, COPE can only provide people with plastic, wooden, or polymer legs. This means that the legs have to be replaced every two years due to wear and tear. (Ideally people would receive titanium legs since they last for 15 to 20 years; however, they are very expensive and that outcome is unlikely.) There is a hanging wall of legs that people donated to the museum once they were worn out after 2 years, showing the number of people who have benefitted from COPE's rehabilitation programs.

COPE is doing life-changing work for people affected by UXOs and mobility-related disabilities in Laos. They are paving the way to a better future for Laos. 

## Legacies of War

Legacies of War is an educational and advocacy organization that works to raise awareness about the Secret War in Laos and urges the U.S. to do more to help remove the UXOs thoroughout the countryside. President Barack Obama publicly recognized the important work that Legacies of War did in 2016 and thanked the founder for working to help Laos move towards a brighter future.

## Cluster Munitions Today

Recently President Biden authorized Congress to give cluster munitions to Ukraine to help them fight Russia. Looking at the matter historically, this idea could wreak havoc on the landscape and the people of Ukraine for many years to come.
