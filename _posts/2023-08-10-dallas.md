I have about a week left in Dallas before I fly to Laos. I am still getting things together and packing school supplies, prizes for students, gifts for my fellow teachers, and English language learning material. I'm especially excited about the National Geographic almanacs that I bought to encourage my students to read! I am gifting my fellow teachers "Hey y'all" Texas dishtowels and American flag pins accompanied by a nice card. 

## Flight to Laos

I fly to Laos on August 17, 2023, and my flight will take 23 hours total. I fly to Qatar, then off to Bangkok, and finally to Vientiane (i.e., the capital of Laos) for a month of orientation. I will arrive in Vientiane on August 19th. I hope that the jet lag isn't too bad!!
