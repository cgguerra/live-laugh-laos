## A week left in Dallas

Hello, everyone! I have about a week left in Dallas before I fly to Laos. I am still getting things together and packing school supplies, prizes for students, gifts for my fellow teachers, and English language learning material. (I'm especially excited about the National Geographic almanacs that I bought to encourage my students to read!)
