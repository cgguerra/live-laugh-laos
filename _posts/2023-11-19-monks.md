One of the most interesting things in my daily life is talking to Buddhist monks at the bus stop and teaching several monks in my classes at Dong Duk. 

## Buddhist Monks' Daily Lives

The monks in Laos aren't allowed to drive cars or motorbikes, so almost all monks take the bus. Monks are allowed to ride bicycles, but usually bicycles are too expensive and the wats are far away from the National University of Laos, so it isn't too common to see monks on bicycles.

The monks aren't allowed to sit next to women on the bus, so when they board, they try to sit next to other men or other monks. If they can't find a spot next to other men, everyone has to reconfigure the bus's seating. This happens every day. The monks usually sit at the back of the bus since the row is much longer, and this guarantees that several monks can sit together without having to reconfigure the bus.

Women are NEVER supposed to touch monks! (This is a HUGE faux pas in Laos.)

Most monks are very well-educated and have attended university. Almost all wats have head monks who speak English and help younger monks learn and practice. The monks are usually better than other students at English because they have more time to practice and more resources for learning. In the summer when there is no school, the monks in university mostly do their chores and study English for the rest of the time (confirmed by a monk I met who told me this). Monks love to practice their English with foreigners, so don't be surprised if they are chatty if you meet some! I have talked to many monks at the bus stop and have asked them about their daily lives. I usually give them my extra worksheets from the American Center so they have some extra practice that they can do at home. Monks want to learn English so they can talk to foreigners and tell them about their wats and about Buddhism.

## Teaching Buddhist Monks

I teach 3 Buddhist monks at the National University of Laos and a monk at the American Center. Because I am a woman, I am not allowed to hand the monks anything. If I want to give them a paper or a sticker, I have to set the object on the desk for the monk to pick up. 

The monks are usually a little more advanced in English since they have more time to practice, and like to ask questions. They asked me how old I was (22) and if I was married (I'm not). They are good students, and they always do their exercises. 

Unsurprisingly, monks in Laos are also on their phones a lot, just like everyone else in the world. Sometimes I have to gently remind my monks to please put their phones away in class. All monks have cell phones and have Facebook accounts. Monks usually have pictures of themselves as the lock screen (all my Lao students do this) and a picture of them with temple elders at their wat as their background. The monks have Facebook accounts and have "Monk" in front of their names.

You can respectfully address a monk as "ku-bah" ("monk") in Lao. It's the same thing as addressing a Catholic priest as "father." It is common to politely refer to people by their titles in Laos. For example, all my students call me "teacher" or "ajahn." Most students do not include a first name or a last name after "teacher," because that is how it is done in Lao.

## What Buddhist Monks Wear

I was talking to one monk at the bus stop, and he told me that monks in Thailand and Laos are only allowed to wear yellow, orange, and red robes. All Buddhist monks shave their heads and wear sandals. Monks always have an orange parasol with them to keep the sun off them and carry bags with Buddha's wheel or nagas given to them by the temple.

These monks have parasols and wear red and orange robes. Notice that they are holding bags from the temple. 

There are very few female monks in Laos, and it is uncommon to see them often. I saw a female monk once at the bus station, and she was wearing lavender robes. 

## Buddhist Monks: Part 2

I will write another post about novice monks in Laos since they are common. Until next time!

	const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

	x2 = number * 0.5F;
	y  = number;
	i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
	i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
	y  = * ( float * ) &i;
	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
