title: Exploring "Sinh City"
categories: [beginning]
---

I have had a great day today! I met some of the new ETAs today that are also assigned to Vientiane, and we went exploring around the city. We surprisingly did a lot of things in 3 1/2 hours. 

## Lao Breakfast
I had my first Lao breakfast at the hotel this morning, which was absolutely delicious. Traditional Lao breakfast consists of noodles and soup (congee). I had fried rice and mushroom congee, and they were absolutely wonderful. Fresh juice is also popular and is served at every restaurant in Laos.

The hotel that we're staying at (i.e., Family Boutique Hotel) is great because it has nice air conditioning and a fabulous breakfast offered every morning as part of your stay. If you ever come to Vientiane you should definitely stay here!

## Talat Sao (Morning Market)
We went out with Christina P. meet her cousin and aunt who live in Laos. The purpose of our visit was to buy sinhs (traditional skirts) at Talat Sao ("Talat" means "market" and "Sao" means "morning"). We arrived at 8:45, which is a super early morning for Lao people. I have learned that Laos is very laidback and Lao people take time to enjoy life by slowing down and starting work later in the morning. 

Christina P. and I (Christina G.) bought sinhs that we can wear to school when we're teaching. Women are required to wear sinhs at university and in government buildings. Sinhs are ubiquitous and it is acceptable to wear them anywhere in Laos. I read somewhere that some people refer to Vientiane as "Sinh City," which I naturally thought was awesome! 

I bought 5 everyday sinhs for 1,000,000 kip ($50). When you buy a sinh in Laos you buy the fabric from a shop after bartering for a good price. (Christina P.'s cousin did this for us.) Then you take it to a tailor to have them fit the sinh to your body. The tailoring will cost me another 100,000 kip per sinh (500,000 kip for all five so $25 total.) In total each sinh will cost me about 300,000 kip including tailoring services ($15). We took our sinhs to the tailor and she measured our hips, waist, and the length of our legs. (The tailor remarked that I was very tall.) Our sinhs will be done next week, and we'll pick them up then. 

I unfortunately do not have any pictures of my sinhs since we immediately took them to the tailor after purchasing them, but I will add one to this post once we pick up our sinhs. They are all long and will reach my ankles when they are done. The sinhs that I chose have no pattern or a striped pattern with a large decorative border embroidered with gold thread at the hem. (The tailor remarked that I had good taste for a foreigner, which was good to hear.) I excited to own such a beautiful piece of clothing that is tailored to fit my body. 



Hello, everyone! Today is the day that I leave for Laos. I fly from Qatar to Bangkok to Vientiane. My flight time is 23 hours! After I arrive, we will begin orientation on August 21st. Our orientation will include intensive Lao lessons, history lessons, and field trips to places of cultural significance.

#### But it's probably overkill (h4)

##### Could be a smaller sub-heading, `pacman` (h5)

### Highlight the code please!!

{% highlight c %}
float Q_rsqrt( float number )
{
	long i;
	float x2, y;
	const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

	x2 = number * 0.5F;
	y  = number;
	i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
	i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
	y  = * ( float * ) &i;
	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
//	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, this can be removed

	return y;
}
