I am excited to go to Laos! I have been researching Lao culture, traditions, and popular cities since June of 2022 when I started writing drafts of my Fulbright essays. 

Here are some interesting web pages, pictures, and videos of Laos if you would like to learn more. 

## Overview of Laos

Most people that I have talked to have not known anything about Laos because there is not a lot of information available. It seems that most of the tourism and international recognition in Southeast Asia goes to neighboring Thailand. (Thailand is located to the left of Laos.) This makes Laos a hidden gem, if anything!

Check out the [Wikipedia page for Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos)


## Famous sites in Laos

Laos has many sites of cultural importance in Vientiane, which is where this stupa is located.
