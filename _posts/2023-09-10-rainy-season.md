title: Welcome to the Rainy Season
categories: [culture]
---

Hello and welcome to the rainy season! Even though I've been in Laos for a little over three weeks in the midst of the rainy season, it has only rained four times. It rained profusely last Thursday. The rain just kept coming in big droplets and flooded some of the streets of Vientiane. The water was up to my ankles at the street by the hotel after only about 10 minutes of flooding. I didn't stick around to find out how much higher it would get.

I know this street doesn't look very flooded, but it definitely was! This was a low spot by the hotel. My sneakers were completely soaked.

The difference between rain in the United States and the rain in Laos is that the rain in Laos comes in heavy droplets in intense showers. Even if it rains for only ten minutes, low points in the street are usually flooded. If it rains for an hour or more, anyone walking outside will be completely soaked in a matter of minutes. There's a reason that Laos has so many vibrant green plants!

## The End of the Rainy Season

I woke up this morning to pitter patter of raindrops on my window. It was very relaxing. (Perhaps because I was inside instead of outside while the rain shower was occurring.) However, the rainy season is not supposed to last for much longer. By October, the rains will stop and the dry season will begin. The temperature will become much cooler and perhaps, just perhaps, the humidity in the air will decrease slightly. 

## Sunday Dinner with Christina P.'s Cousin

### Differences in Serving Alcohol at Celebrations in Laos and the U.S.

Today we had Sunday dinner with Christina P.'s cousin. He was celebrating his promotion since he is the new head of police at his local station. In Lao culture, the host offers you a drink and they drink first if you ask them to. The host will offer you many drinks throughout the course of the night, typically. I didn't want anything to drink since I don't like whiskey or beer, and I have to go to Lao language class tomorrow. However, it was very difficult to refuse since Lao people want their guests to drink and have a good time. The host wants their guest to celebrate with them, so offering guests alcohol multiple times is seen as a friendly gesture rather than a form of peer pressure. Offering guests drinks several times is indicative of a caring host in Laos, and this is not a form of hazing like it is in the United States. 

You can refuse if you don't want to drink, but you are encouraged to imbibe. My fellow ETAs had a few drinks, and the host enjoyed that they wanted to celebrate with him in that way. The host must have asked me to drink 6 or 7 times, and each time I refused. (He also asked the other ETAs 6 or 7 seven times. I mention this to show that I was not singled out.) My fellow ETAs recommended that I bring a pill bottle next time so I can point to it and say I can't have alcohol. (I can drink alcohol, but I just don't want any and the host will not take no for an answer unless I make up a good reason because drinking with the host at a party is a part of Lao celebration culture.) Next time I will definitely bring a medicine bottle!

The most popular alcohol for important dinner celebrations in Laos is Johnny Walker. Beer Lao is also hyperpresent in Laos, so this is always served at parties. 

### Celebrating Christina P.'s Cousin

Much of Christina P.'s family was at the celebration for her uncle. Lao people are warm and kind and are eager to treat their guests well. Her family said they hoped to see us again soon and that they hope we will come celebrate with them again.

At traditional dinners in Laos, you grab sticky rice out of the small baskets with your hands, ball it up, and eat it with sauce. There is usually one basket of sticky rice for every two or three people. You eat noodles and meats with chopsticks and soups with a separate bowl and spoon. (At traditonal meals, you normally sits on pillows on the floor and put the big dishes on the table; however, we ate outside, so we sat in chairs.) Traditional Lao meals are always served potluck style. 

We had fish curry, chicken wings, congealed pork intestines, and spaghetti. I didn't try any of the congealed pork intestines since I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous. Pa Khong (Christina's aunt) made us spaghetti since it was a special occasion, and she wanted to prepare something that she knew we ate at home. Lao spaghetti sauce is much sweeter than Italian marinara sauce in general. I really enjoyed the spaghetti since I have not had any pasta since I left the U.S. almost a month ago.

Notice the khao niao ("sticky rice") in the small woven baskets!
