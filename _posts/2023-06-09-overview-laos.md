title: An Overview of Laos

I am excited to go to Laos! I have been researching Lao culture, traditions, and popular cities since June of 2022 when I started writing drafts of my Fulbright essays. 

Here are some interesting web pages, pictures, and videos of Laos if you would like to learn more. 

## What people know about Laos

Most people that I have talked to have not known anything about Laos because there is not a lot of information available. It seems that most of the tourism and international recognition in Southeast Asia goes to neighboring Thailand. (Thailand is located to the left of Laos.) 

Below is a picture of the resources available for learing about Laos at the Loyola Notre Dame Library. Countries like India and China had several entire bookshelves filled with books on history, language, art, and culture. Laos, by comparison, had very little information available. (I drew brackets around the books that focused on Laos in red to show how few resources there are available.) So, even if you did really want to learn about Laos, there does not seem to be much scholarship and research available.This makes Laos a hidden gem in need of more attention and research, if anything!

## Country Profile of Laos

[The National Geographic Kids Country Profile of Laos](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/laos) is a great resource for a brief summary of Lao culture, traditions, and way of life.

Check out the [Wikipedia page for Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos)


## Geography of Laos

Laos borders 5 countries including Thailand, Burma, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Laos is the only land-locked country in Southeast Asia. The Mekong river runs straight through the middle of the country and divides Laos and Thailand.

I will attend orientation in Vientiane, the capital of Laos. Vientiane is the biggest city in Laos and has around 721,000 residents. After orientation, some of the other ETAs will travel to Savannakhet and Pakse to teach English. I will be teaching at the Naitonal University of Laos, so I will stay in Vientiane for the duration of my grant.

## Famous sites in Laos

Laos has many sites of cultural importance in Vientiane, which is where this stupa is located. The English Teaching Assistants (ETAs) will probably take a field trip here to learn about sites of cultural importance in Vientiane during orientation.
